This example produces a lot of files. Be careful you don't run out of space if you run this alot!
Printed out are the FPT distributions from each individual minima to A, and also the FPT distributions
from each individual minima to B. 
i.e. waitlnpdfA.4 is the same as waitlnpdfAB.1.0000000000
eigendataA.X gives information about the dominant eigenmodes that contribute to the FPT distributions
for the transition A<-X.
Columns one gives the eigenmode index, column two the amplitude (might be scale I can't remember),
and column three the negative eigenvalue
peaksA.X list the locations in (x,y) of the peaks in the FPT distribution
Looking at peaksA.X (and peaksB.X) is useful to determine which transitions show interesting kinetics

Things to think about:
- Explore the FPT distributions
- What sort of transitions are more likely to have multiple peaks?
