Files needed to compute first passage time distributions within the nine community landscape
"pathdata" file tells PATHSAMPLE how to run
The FPT distribution for the transition A<-B can be found in waitlnpdfAB.1.0000000000 
We normally plot in ln(t) rather than time, because rates are exponentially sensitive to energy barriers
Try changing min.A and min.B files and the temperature to see how the FPT changes
min.A and min.B files: First line is the number of minima in the file. Each subsequent line is the minima index. 
You can have one than one minima in min.A and min.B
Can you see how the FPT distribution computed begins to look garbage as the temperature is reduced?
