This example runs through a simple partial Graph Transformation example based 
on Dijkstra's algorithm, for the nine community landscape. 

First we find Dijkstra's shortest path between our source(s) and sink(s)
The keyword Dijkstra will find the shortest paths between all pairs of minima
in the file DijkstraList
Pathsample will output the following:
onpath (the minima on the shortest paths)
onpath.1 (the minima one step away from minima on the shortest paths)
onpath.X (the minima X steps away from minima on the shortest paths)

Next we run pGT to only keep the minima on the shortest path + 2, as well as the 
minima at the bottom of trapping basins. 
Copy globmin.txt, onpath, onpath.1 and onpath.2 into NGTkeeplist
Now run pathsample using the NGT and NGTKEEPLIST keywords. 
This will produce min.data.new, ts.data.new, min.A.new and min.B.new files
Copy these files into a new directory and rename as min.data ts.data etc
Compute the FPT on this reduced network.
After pGT the keyword FREENERGY is used to tell pathsample to read in the min.data
and ts.data files differently

Check to see whether your FPT after pGT is the same as computing the FPT on 
the full network.

Can you reproduce for different min.A and min.B?
