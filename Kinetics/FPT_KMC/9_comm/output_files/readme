Files needed to compute first passage time distributions within the nine community landscape
"pathdata" file tells PATHSAMPLE how to run
The data required to plot the FPT distribution can be found in output
In order to view the useful lines separately use:
'grep "KMC steps in time" output > KMC.steps'
This will output the useful lines
You can go further and take the useful columns
awk '{print $6 " " $11 " " $14}' KMC.steps > KMC.data
First columns of KMC.data: The number of kMC steps taken during one kMC path A<-B (let's call this X)
Second column: The total time taken to do those X steps
Third column: The expected number of kMC steps (=number of kMC steps if leapfrog is off)
We now have a set of times taken for the transition A<-B.
This can be plotted as a histogram using the python script provided.

Things to think about:
- How does the FPT distribution produced change if you run fewer or more kMCs?
-- kMC is a stochastic method. The result should converge towards the deterministic result from eigendecomposition.
- Do you notice how slow the program gets if you reduce the temperature?
