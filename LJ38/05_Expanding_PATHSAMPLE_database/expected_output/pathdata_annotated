! PATHSAMPLE input to expand the database for LJ38 using the UNTRAP approach
! For further details, see the PATHSAMPLE documentation

! the path to the OPTIM binary to use
EXEC           /home/energy/workshop/binaries/OPTIM
! run OPTIM locally on a single core - modify as appropriate
CPUS           1
! specifies the atom type to be used in OPTIM and thus the potential, in this case Lennard-Jones
SYSTEM         AX
! the number of atoms in the system
NATOMS         38
! specify the random number seed, used to make stochastic calculations repeatable
SEED           1
! specify the direction of the pathway using spectroscopic convention i.e. AB = A<-B where A and B are the endpoints
! in min.A and min.B respectively
DIRECTION      AB
! minimum number of connected minima to be found for new minimum
CONNECTIONS    1
! specify the temperature to use when calculating rate constants 
TEMPERATURE    0.1

! when aligning structures, minimise the distance between stationary points with respect to permutational isomerisation
! as we are not providing a perm.allow file, all atoms are considered to be identical
PERMDIST       0.01D0
! try 5 random starting alignments as well as the standard one when using PERMDIST
RANROT         5
! define the energy and distance cutoffs below which we assume structures are identical - matches odata.connect
ETOL           1.0D-6
GEOMDIFFTOL    0.2
! additionally use a principal moment of inertia tensor difference criterion for distinguishing stationary points
ITOL           0.1D0

! choose minima to connect using a scheme designed to eliminate kinetic traps
! details beyond the scope of this example - see the PATHSAMPLE documentation 
UNTRAP         0.035 3.0
! run 50 connection cycles (50 x CPUS OPTIM jobs)
CYCLES         50
