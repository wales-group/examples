! PATHSAMPLE input to create an initial database from OPTIM path.info for LJ38
! For further details, see the PATHSAMPLE documentation

! the path to the OPTIM binary to use
EXEC           /home/energy/workshop/binaries/OPTIM
! run OPTIM locally on a single core - modify as appropriate
CPUS           1
! specifies the atom type to be used in OPTIM and thus the potential, in this case Lennard-Jones
SYSTEM         AX
! the number of atoms in the system
NATOMS         38
! specify the random number seed, used to make calculations repeatable
SEED           1
! specify the direction of the pathway using spectroscopic convention i.e. AB = A<-B where A and B are the endpoints
! in min.A and min.B respectively
DIRECTION      AB
! minimum number of connected minima to be found for new minimum
CONNECTIONS    1
! specify the temperature to use when calculating rate constants 
TEMPERATURE    0.1

! when aligning structures, minimise the distance between stationary points with respect to permutational isomerisation
! as we are nor providing a perm.allow file, all atoms are considered to be identical
PERMDIST 
! try 5 random starting alignments as well as the standard one when using PERMDIST
RANROT         5
! define the energy and distance cutoffs below which we assume structures are identical - matches odata.connect
ETOL           1.0D-6
GEOMDIFFTOL    0.2
! additionally use a principal moment of inertia tensor difference criterion for distinguishing stationary points
ITOL           0.1D0

! STEP 1: creating the initial database from OPTIM path.info file
! use the stationary points in path.info.initial to create an initial PATHSAMPLE database
! min.A and min.B are set to 1 and 2 as a baseline to be changed 
STARTFROMPATH  path.info.initial 1 2
! don't run any OPTIM connection cycles - we only want to set the database up at this point
CYCLES         0

! STEP 2: run a Dijkstra analysis to identify the 'fastest path' (initially commented) 
! perform a Dijkstra analysis, ignoring any minima with 0 or less connections
! DIJKSTRA       0
! don't run any OPTIM connection cycles, we only want to identify the fastest path
! CYCLES         0
