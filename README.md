# examples
Curated examples for use in workshops teaching the use of the Wales Group codes

This repository is initially intended to act as a place to maintain backups of examples as they are developed.

For each workshop, a public snapshot can be created and cloned onto the VM being used. This would then allow participants to 'git pull' to ensure everyone has the same version and to distribute bug fixes during the workshop.
