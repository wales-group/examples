! ALGORITHM SETUP

! specify the RMS force convergence criteria for:
! quenches (Qu) during the basin-hopping (BH) run
SLOPPYCONV 1.0D-6
! final quenches for the SAVE lowest energy minima
TIGHTCONV 1.0D-8 

! consider minima unique if they differ by less than 0.003 
EDIFF 5.0D-5

! set the max number of minimisation steps for sloppy and tight quenches
MAXIT 10000 10000

! set the maximum step size during the L-BFGS minimisation 
MAXBFGS 0.2D0

! set the maximum amount the energy is permitted to rise after an L-BFGS step 
MAXERISE 1.0D-4

! set the target Metropolis acceptance ratio to 0.4 
ACCEPTRATIO 0.4

! set the history size of the L-BFGS algorithm to 500
UPDATES 500

! tightly converge and output the 20 lowest energy structures
SAVE 20

! output additional files to aid analysis of the run:
! produce best, markov and energy files containing those energies each quench
TRACKDATA

! produce a GMIN dump file for use with RESTORE every 6000 BH steps
DUMPINT 6000

! create AMBER specific .pdb and .rst files for each tightly converged minimum
DUMPSTRUCTURES

! SAMPLING PARAMETERS

! set the temperature used when accepting and rejecting minima into the Markov
! chain (multiples of kT in the underlying energy units)
TEMPERATURE 0.8

! do 500 BH steps multiplying the temperate by 1.0 each step
STEPS 500 1.0

! generate new geometries each BH step by applying a random Cartesian displacement
! of up to 1.0 to each LJ atom...
STEP 1.0D0
! ...and rotating atomic groups according to the probabilities and magnitudes 
! defined in the atomgroups file every 1 step
GROUPROTATION 1

! specify that we are using the AMBER potential via an interface to AMBER 12 
! initial coordinates will be read from coords.inpcrd in AMBER restart (inpcrd) format
AMBER12 coords.inpcrd inpcrd
